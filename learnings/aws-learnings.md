**üîë Configure Bucket Policy for CloudFront Access**

**Notes on CloudFront UI Updates**

Before setting up a CloudFront distribution, be aware that the AWS UI has changed slightly compared to older tutorials or videos. Here are the key differences:

1. Delivery Method

- Previously, you had to choose between Web and RTMP.

- The RTMP option has been removed, so CloudFront now defaults to Web delivery. No manual selection is required.

2. Distribution Settings

- What was earlier called ‚ÄúDistribution settings‚Äù is now simply labeled ‚ÄúSettings.‚Äù

3. SSL Certificate

- The SSL certificate fields look different.

- You won‚Äôt see the default CloudFront certificate explicitly shown, but rest assured, the default certificate is still applied automatically‚Äîno action needed.
