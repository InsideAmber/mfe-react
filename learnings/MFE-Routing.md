üîπ Microfrontend Routing Requirements (Explained)

1. Both the Container + Individual SubApps need routing features

- The container app handles top-level navigation (e.g.,` /auth`, `/dashboard`).

- Each sub-app may also have its own routes (`/auth/login`, `/auth/signup`).

- Both must coexist without clashing.

2. Sub-apps might need to add in new pages/routes all the time

- Teams should be able to add or update routes inside their own microfrontend without modifying the container.

- Example: Marketing team adds `/pricing` ‚Üí should work without container changes.

3. We might need to show two or more microfrontends at the same time

- Sometimes, the container needs to render multiple MFEs together (e.g., Dashboard showing `Analytics + Notifications`).

- Routing should allow parallel rendering.

4. We want to use off-the-shelf routing solutions

- Instead of building custom routing logic, we rely on libraries like React Router, Angular Router, Vue Router.

- Each MFE can use the same routing library to simplify integration.

5. We need navigation features for sub-apps in both hosted mode and in isolation

- Sub-app must work standalone (`npm start`) with routing.

- Sub-app must also work inside the container (`npm run serve`) without breaking.

6. If different apps need to communicate about routing, it should be generic

- Avoid hardcoding "container tells sub-app X".

- Use events or history API so MFEs remain independent.

- Example: If user navigates in container ‚Üí sub-apps should respond via shared history object.

Routing in MFE:

```ascii
                +------------------+
                |    Container     |
                |  (Global Routes) |
                +------------------+
                 /        |       \
                /         |        \
               v          v         v
   +----------------+  +----------------+  +----------------+
   |   SubApp A     |  |   SubApp B     |  |   SubApp C     |
   |  (/auth/*)     |  | (/dashboard/*) |  | (/marketing/*) |
   +----------------+  +----------------+  +----------------+

[Features Needed]
1. Container + SubApps both define routes
2. SubApps can add new routes freely
3. Multiple SubApps can render at same time
4. Use off-the-shelf routers (React Router, etc.)
5. SubApps work standalone & inside container
6. Routing communication must be generic
```

üß© Problem Setup

- Container App

  - Has a header with a logo ‚Üí supposed to redirect to `/`.

  - No routing logic in container (just renders sub-apps).

- Marketing App

  - Has its own routes:

    - `/` ‚Üí Landing Page

    - `/pricing` ‚Üí Pricing Page

- What happens now?

  - You navigate to `/pricing` (shows Pricing page ‚úÖ).

  - You click Logo in Container ‚Üí container changes URL to `/`.

  - But UI still shows Pricing (‚ùå), because Marketing App‚Äôs router didn‚Äôt notice container‚Äôs navigation.

Why this happens?

Since container has no routing logic, it doesn‚Äôt mount/unmount MFEs based on route.

- Marketing is always mounted.

- React Router inside Marketing listens to its own history instance.

- But when Container changes URL ‚Üí Marketing‚Äôs router doesn‚Äôt get updated (they are disconnected).

Solution

Yes ‚Äì you do need routing logic at the container level (at least minimal).

Two Approaches:

1. Container controls which sub-app mounts (Recommended)

- Container uses its own router (React Router, Vue Router, etc.).

- Example:

  - `/` ‚Üí render Marketing (Landing)

  - `/pricing` ‚Üí render Marketing (Pricing)

  - `/auth/*` ‚Üí render Auth app

This way ‚Üí when logo navigates to `/`, container re-renders Marketing at root route ‚Üí React Router inside Marketing will naturally show Landing.

2. Share history between Container + SubApp (Advanced)

- Instead of container routing, pass down a shared `history` object to sub-apps.

- Container navigation (`/`) triggers same history object ‚Üí Marketing router updates.

- This requires wiring React Router in both places to the same history.

Rule of Thumb

- If container should control which microfrontend shows up ‚Üí container must have routing logic.

- If container is ‚Äúdumb shell‚Äù and only loads one sub-app at a time ‚Üí share history so both stay in sync.

üîß Fix for Your Case

Since you said container has no routing but has a header with logo:

- Best Fix ‚Üí Add minimal routing in container:

```tsx
// ContainerApp.tsx
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom";
import MarketingApp from "./MarketingApp";

export default function ContainerApp() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Header /> {/* Logo inside this navigates to "/" */}
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/*" element={<MarketingApp />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

Note: - in microfrontends we typically share either BrowserHistory or MemoryHistory, depending on how we want the container and child apps to sync.

ASCII Diagram for this particular project router setup:

                +---------------------------+
                |         CONTAINER         |

                |   Controls real URL bar   |
                +-------------+-------------+
                              |
         -----------------------------------------------
         |                                             |
+-------------------------+             +-------------------------+
|       MARKETING         |             |          AUTH           |
| React Router (Memory)   |             | React Router (Memory)   |
| Local navigation only   |             | Local navigation only   |
| Not changing URL bar    |             | Not changing URL bar    |
+-------------------------+             +-------------------------+

```

Why This Router Setup?

In a microfrontend (MFE) system:

- Container App is responsible for the overall application and controls the real browser URL. That‚Äôs why it uses Browser History (so the URL is synced, bookmarkable, reloadable).

- Sub-apps (Marketing, Auth, etc.) are mounted inside the container. If they also tried to use `BrowserHistory`, multiple apps could fight over the URL at the same time.

- To prevent this conflict, sub-apps use Memory History.

  - MemoryHistory keeps routing changes local to the sub-app.

  - When the container needs to know about navigation, the sub-app can ‚Äúnotify‚Äù the container.

  - The container then decides if/when to update the actual browser history.

This way, we get a clean separation:

- Container = controls the real URL.

- Sub-apps = handle their own routing internally without breaking others.

**Benefits of this Approach**

- Avoids conflicts ‚Üí Only one app (the container) controls the real URL.

- Isolation ‚Üí Sub-apps can add/remove routes anytime without breaking container or other MFEs.

- Flexibility ‚Üí Container can decide when to sync sub-app navigation with the real URL.

- Scalability ‚Üí More MFEs can be added without changing routing strategy.
